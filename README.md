# Ottello-Game
Othello AI Game with Minimax and Alpha-Beta Pruning

This project implements an AI-driven Othello game using the Minimax algorithm with Alpha-Beta pruning. The game includes the following features:

- **🧠 Minimax with Alpha-Beta Pruning:**  
  Optimizes the search tree by eliminating unnecessary branches.

- **🔍 Dynamic Depth Adjustment:**  
  The AI adapts its search depth based on the number of empty spaces on the board.

- **⏳ Time-Limited Depth Search:**  
  Uses iterative deepening to handle time constraints, ensuring optimal moves within a given time limit.

- **🎯 Board Visualization:**  
  Highlights valid moves and dynamically updates the board after each move.

- **🤖 Player vs AI Interaction:**  
  Supports both dynamic and time-limited strategies for AI depth.
